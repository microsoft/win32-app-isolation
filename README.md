# Welcome to the Win32 app isolation repo
Win32 app isolation is a new security feature on Windows that helps contain the damage and safeguard user privacy choices in the event of an 
application compromise. 
Win32 app isolation is built on the foundation of [AppContainers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/implementing-an-appcontainer), which offer a security boundary, 
and components that virtualize resources and provide brokered access to other resources. 
This repo should be used only to file bugs or feature requests, and to ask questions. To learn more about the feature and how to enable it for your app, visit the main Win32 app isolation page at [MS Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/app-isolation-overview).
