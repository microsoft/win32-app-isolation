# Welcome to the Win32 app isolation repo
Win32 app isolation is a new security feature on Windows that helps contain the damage and safeguard user privacy choices in the event of an 
application compromise. 
Win32 app isolation is built on the foundation of [AppContainers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/implementing-an-appcontainer), which offer a security boundary, 
and components that virtualize resources and provide brokered access to other resources. 
This repo contains the documentation and tools to help you isolate your applications.

## Getting started 
* The first step to isolating your application is to package it to run isolated by following the instructions

	* [using the MSIX packaing tool](docs/packaging/msix-packaging-tool.md)
	* or [using Visual Studio](docs/packaging/packaging-with-visual-studio.md)
	
* Once you have your application packaged, use [Application Capability Profiler](docs/profiler/application-capability-profiler.md) to update the application to grant it access to additional resources.
* We also have additional documentation about the [fundamentals](docs/fundamentals) including file access consent.
* You're now ready to deploy and run your application on Windows.

Binaries for the tools used to package applications to run isolated are shared under the [releases](https://github.com/microsoft/win32-app-isolation/releases) section of the repo.

Release notes for supported Windows builds and tools can be found [here](relnotes/windows-release-notes.md).
